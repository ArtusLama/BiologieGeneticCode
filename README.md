# BiologieGeneticCodeToAminoacid
 This tool can convert a sequence of Nucleinbases into an Aminoacid

# How to use?
 Just copy the code and call 'get_amino_acids_from_dna' at the end of the file (or in a new one and import the main.py)
 As input the function takes a list of the Nucleinbases. For example ["T", "A", "C", "C", "T", "A", ...]
 IMPORTANT: Don't forget to have an start and stop sequence in the list.
 (start: "T", "A", "C")
 (stop: "A", "T", "T" or "A", "T", "C" or "A", "C", "T")

 For example: get_amino_acids_from_dna(list("AACTACCGATGACTATGGAGAACCCACTCGGGTTGCACTAAA"))
